OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By using EM-uNetPi, you can perform the following line simulation.

- network bandwidth simulation
- network delay simulation
- packet loss simulation
- disconnections simulation
- symmetric-NAT simulation

Further, these simulations can be performed by the following method.

- select preset params
- set parameter directly
- set parameter by api
- replay recorded delay-data ( * temporarily unavailable )

The figure below is a demonstration screen in direct designation mode.
